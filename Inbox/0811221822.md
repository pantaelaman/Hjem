##### Vectors and Scalars
Vectors are values that have both direction and magnitude, and scalars only have a magnitude. Scalars are used to *scale* vectors, hence the name.

```ad-tip
Vectors have a simple, defined form:
$$
\begin{gather}
||v|| = \sqrt{ v^2_x + v^2_y } \\
\angle v = \arctan \left ( \frac{v_y}{v_x} \right )
\end{gather}
$$
With these two formulas, you can quickly calculate the most important information about a vector.
In addition, there are formulas to go from the direction & magnitude to component form:
$$
\begin{gather}
v_{x_{0}} = ||v|| \cos (\angle v) \\
v_{y_{0}} = ||v|| \sin (\angle v) \\
\end{gather}
$$
This is essential for some later problems involving conversions between the two forms.
```

##### Projectile Motion
Projectiles will always follow a parabolaic path, disregarding air resistance and other interfering factors. This assumes $a_x = 0$, and $a_y$ is some constant, usually defined by gravity. If this is true, then the following formulas can be derived:
$$
\begin{gather}
d_{x} = v_{x_{0}}t \\
d_{y} = y_{0} + v_{y_{0}}t + \frac{a_{y}}{2}t^2 \\
v_{y} = v_{y_{0}} + a_{y}t
\end{gather}
$$
And, less obviously, for projectiles where $y_0 = d_{y}$, $v_{y} = -v_{y_{0}}$; essentially the final $y$ velocity is equal to the negative initial $y$ velocity, so we can modify the third equation to look something like this:
$$
-\frac{2v_{y_{0}}}{g}=t
$$
A method to solve for the time based on the initial $y$ velocity, which proves invaluable in solving more complex problems. Another helpful couple of formulas to know are solving for the components of a vector given magnitude and angle.
