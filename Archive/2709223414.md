# Calc 3 - Parametric Equations
## Equations where x and y are unrelated
#maths #calc3

A parametric equation can be written as two separate equations, one for $x$ and one for $y$ as functions of a third value, which I'll call $t$ for now. One can plot this shape on a two-dimensional graph by eliminating the $t$ value.

##### Graphing Two-dimensionally
Consider the parametric equation $y = \sin t$, $x = \cos t$, $0 \le t \le 2\pi$. We can create a new equation such that the trig functions containing $t$ disappear with the trig identity $\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1$. Substituting $y$ for $\sin t$ and $x$ for $\cos t$ gives us the equation $y^2 + x^2 = 1$.
