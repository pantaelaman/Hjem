##### Velocity vs Speed
Speed is a single number that indicates how fast one is going. Velocity is both a magnitude and a direction that indicates how fast one is going AND in what direction they are moving.
Average velocity/speed can be calculated with:
$$
\overline{v}=\frac{v_{f}+v_{i}}{2}
$$
$$
\overline{s}=\frac{s_{f} + s_{i}}{2}
$$
provided that acceleration is constant throughout. This is helpful for other equations later down the road.

##### Acceleration
Acceleration is the change in velocity over time, and be calculated with the handy formula:
$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} =
\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{\Delta t}
$$
This equation is very helpful, and can be permuted to solve for final or initial velocity and time as well.

##### Acceleration: combined equations
$$
\begin{align}
& \overline{v} = \frac{x - x_{0}}{t} \\
\\
& a = \frac{v - v_{0}}{t} \\
\\
& \overline{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2} \\
\\
& v = v_{0} + at
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{gather}
x = x_{0} + \overline{v}t \\
x = x_{0} + \left( \frac{v_{0} + v}{2} \right)t \\
x = x_{0} + \left( \frac{v_{0} + v_{0} + at}{2} \right)t \\
x = x_{0} + \left( \frac{2v_{0}+at}{2} \right)t \\
x = x_{0} + v_{0}t + \frac{at^2}{2}
\end{gather}
$$
Where acceleration is constant. This formula can also be differentiated to solve for velocity:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}x = v = v_{0} + at
$$
Likewise, if you know the formula for acceleration, you can integrate to go backwards to find the formulas for velocity and distance. For instance, if $a$ is not constant, but is actually defined by the equation $a = kt + a_{0}$ where $k$ is a constant (from $\int k \, dt = kt + a_{0}$ , we can integrate to find the equation for velocity:
$$
\begin{gather}
v = \int a \, dt \\
v = \int kt + a_{0} \, dt \\
v = \frac{kt^2}{2} + a_{0}t + v_{0}
\end{gather}
$$
And again to solve for distance:
$$
\begin{gather}
x = \int v \, dt \\
x = \int \frac{kt^2}{2} + a_{0}t + v_{0} \, dt \\
x = \frac{k}{2} \int t^2 \, dt + \int a_{0}t \, dt  + \int v_{0} \, dt \\
x = \frac{kt^3}{6} + \frac{a_{0}t^2}{2} + v_{0}t + x_{0}
\end{gather}
$$
Another combined formula which can be solved for results in:
$$
v^2 = v_{0}^2 + 2a(x - x_{0})
$$
This one is particularly handy because there is no $t$ variable included, which means that it is possible to solve for distance, acceleration, or velocity without $t$.
