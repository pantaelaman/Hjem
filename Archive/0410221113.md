# Calc 2 - Rules of Integration
## The Only Way
#maths #calc2 #school 

##### It's just inverse differentiation
A lot of the basic rules can come out of simply reversing the rules we've made for differentiation; for instance:
$$
\begin{align}
& \int x^a \, dx = \frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1} \\
& \int c \, dx = cx \\
& \int cA \, dx = c\int A \, dx  \\
\end{align}
$$
##### Integration by Substitution
One unique way of solving an integral is integration by substitution, also known as inverse chain rule. The rule is thus:
$$
\int f(g(x)) \, g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du 
$$
where $u = g(x)$. This way you can integrate slightly more complicated equations. For instance, take the equation $\sqrt{ x - 4 }$. How can you integrate this? First, take the derivative of $x - 4 = 1$. Then, notice that we can rewrite our original equation: $\sqrt{ x - 4 } \cdot 1 = \sqrt{ f(x) } \cdot f'(x)$ where $f(x) = x - 4$. Thus, we can integrate as follows:
$$
\begin{gather}
\int \sqrt{ f(x) } \cdot f'(x) \, dx \\
\int \sqrt{ u } \, du \\
\frac{2(\sqrt{ u })^3}{3} \\
\frac{2(\sqrt{ x - 4 })^3}{3}
\end{gather}
$$

##### Integration by Parts
Another way of integrating is integration by parts, which makes integrations where two functions are multiplied a lot easier:
$$
\int AB \, dx = A\int B \, dx - \int A' \left( \int B \, dx  \right)  \, dx
$$
or more simply:
$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du 
$$
For instance, in the function $xe^x$, the integral can be found by setting $A = x$ and $B = e^x$ and solving from there:
$$
\begin{gather}
\int xe^x \, dx \\
x \int e^x \, dx - \int 1 \cdot \left( \int e^x \, dx  \right) \, dx \\
xe^x - e^x + C \\
e^x(x - 1) + C
\end{gather}
$$

##### Trigonometric Substitution
My least favourite by far. It's pure magic! For instance, the substitution for sine is as such:
$$
\sqrt{ a^2 - b^2x^2 } \ \ \Rightarrow \ \  x = \frac{a}{b}\sin \theta , \  -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}
$$
