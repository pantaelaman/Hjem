##### It's just chain rule, but it looks weird
Let's take the example of $y^2+2yx+x^2=0$. What is the derivative of this equation with respect to $x$?
$$
\begin{gather}
2yy'+2y'+2xy'+2x=0 \\
y'(2y+2+2x)=-2x \\
y'=-\frac{2x}{2(y+x+1)} \\
y'=-\frac{x}{y+x+1}
\end{gather}
$$
This is just a simple use of the chain rule in disguise: for instance what is the derivative of $y^2=0$? Well, we know based on the power rule that the derivative of $u^2$ is $2uu'$, so substituting $u=y$, we get $2yy'$. We apply this sort of technique to every term in the equation and solve for $y'$, giving us our solution.
