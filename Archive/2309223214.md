	- Lived in Prague
	- Had a domineering father, but a kind mother
	- Jewish
	- All of his sisters died in the holocaust
	- "Every revolution evaporates and leaves behind only the slime of a new bureaucracy."

##### Sketching Gregor
- "He was lying on his hard, as it were armour-plated, back" (89)

- "his numerous legs, which were pitifully small compared to the rest of his bulk" (89)
- "Small white spots" (90)

### Journal 1
1. Summary of action: barsneit.                           
2. Quotes:
	- n
	- s
3. Incidents:
	- x
	- p
4. Quotations about:
	- the father:
	- the mother:
	- the sister: “at the other side of the door, the sister was saying in a low, plaintive tone, ‘Gregor? Aren’t you well? Are you needing anything?’” (92) This quote portrays the sister as kind, caring, and helpful, especially towards Gregor.
	- the chief clerk:
5. Most puzzling line: "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect." (89) I believe that this quote is most ambiguous because of the original german text; it leaves the nature of the creature to which Gregor is transformed unclear, as well as how the transformation took place. In addition, the "one morning" part of the sentence feels normal and out of place in the rest of the sentence.
